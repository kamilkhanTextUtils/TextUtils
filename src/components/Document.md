<!-- 1. prop -

Basically In order to reuse the exist component we provided the property using same component and we can use without writing the entire code.
Prop means we passing the property in component during the definition of the component.


2. state - 

syntax -     const [text, setText] = useState(' Any word or value');

It is the concept where the react identify the state variable. Using state we can use dynamically the value of the variable everywhere.
As it's the concept of hooks where we can use every functionalities of class in function without using the class or object.

 <!-- Important -

 If we want to check anything in console we can select that element and add JS code using $0;
It will work only on browser not in code.

Syntax - $0.style.backgroundColor: 'red';  -->

<!-- 3. Router-

Always use path with exact in router because react always partial matching and we should should complete to urls
{/users - Component 1
/users/home - Component 2 

} -->
